Send rant about boss to boss... oops!!! UNDO!

How many times did you (accidentally) send a text to somebody and wished immediately after hitting 'send' that you didn't?

Introducing send14ops!

With send14oops you can send 140 characters to your contacts at a time. And if you realize you've made a mistake undo it. You can delete messages as long as the recipient hasn't read it. It never happened.

Why this app name?
There's a long explanation for it, and it'll make sense... Here's a first hint...
Gotta code... Ain't nobody got time for this!?!

from an irb session

    irb(main):001:0> chars = ('a'..'z').to_a
    => ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j", "k", "l", "m", "n", "o", "p", "q", "r", "s", "t", "u", "v", "w", "x", "y", "z"]
    irb(main):002:0> chars.find_index('o')
    => 14
