How many times did you (accidentally) send a text to somebody and wished immediately after hitting 'send' that you didn't?

Introducing send14ops!

With send14oopsyou can send 140 characters to people. And if you realize you've made a mistake undo it. You can delete messages as long as the recpipient hasn't read it. It never happened.
